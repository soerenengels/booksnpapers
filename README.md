# @booksnpapers

**Books 'n Papers** is a digital book club. Every month we come together at [booksnpapers.de](https://booksnpapers.de/) and discuss a book or scientific paper on the topic of journalism. Ideally, the authors accompany the respective discussion. Interested people are welcome!

At the moment our language is German, as we are based in Halle/Saale, Germany.
